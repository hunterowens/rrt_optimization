This is some work I'm doing at the request of my dad, Curtis Blanton.
To run this script, one needs to install Julia (I'm on version 0.2.1 from 
the Debian repository).
and the following packages

 JuMP, DataFrames, and Clp.
via Pkg.add("JuMP")
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
Pkg.add("Clp")

Put a csv export of the data in a directory called dat/rrt.csv
